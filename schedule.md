| [Discovery 6](https://the-108.mn.co/posts/1174970)    | 2017-06-23          | We've talked about the two major categories of discovery, inbound and outbound, and inbound is generally putting stuff out into the world, which lives independently, letting people stumble upon it, and then letting them follow that back to you. It tends to be a longer game, but if you build that over time, if you build a library of posts or videos or audios or podcasts, whatever it may be, that, over time, can end up becoming a really nice consistent generator of new inquiries, new leads. It's a longer game, with the rare exception of you creating something that happens to go "viral," and that's a moonshot approach. Every once in a really long while, it'll happen, but it's a good idea to enter the inbound game, thinking that that's your long game. | [pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h2kjaymg2c55q9x/108MasterclassDiscovery6.pdf?dl=0)    | [Audiomp3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/saccdbu68tfysiy/Discovery%206.mp3?dl=0)     |
| [Listbuilding 1](https://the-108.mn.co/posts/1182283) | 2017-06-30          | Today's topic is this thing called list building. It follows on the conversations around copywriting and discovery because we want to really understand those topics more broadly first. Then we can dive a little bit more deeply into this idea of list building, what happens in that moment when somebody first interacts, as a general rule, with your website, and then how do you create an opportunity for them to raise their hands, say, "This sounds cool, I want to know more, here is my email so that you can tell me more," and then continue the conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o5fh5tmfjufrrcl/108MasterclassLISTBUILDING1.pdf?dl=0) | [Audio mp3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fi3i51vsgesao6w/Listbuilding%201.mp3?dl=0) |
